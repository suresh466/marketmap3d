# GLOBAL CONTEXT: Settings that apply to ALL server blocks

# --- MIME Types Configuration ---
# include /etc/nginx/mime.types; nginx includes this by default, keep it for educational purposes
# Add custom MIME types for files Nginx doesn't recognize by default
types {
    application/geo+json geojson;
    application/manifest+json webmanifest;
}

# --- Rate Limiting Configuration ---
# This creates a "memory zone" that tracks request rates per IP address, think of it as a ledger: "Who made requests and when?"
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=general_limit:10m rate=10r/s;
# BREAKDOWN:
# - $binary_remote_addr: The visitor's IP in binary format (more memory efficient)
# - zone=general_limit:10m: Creates a 10MB memory zone called "general_limit"
#   (10MB can track ~160,000 unique IP addresses)
# - rate=10r/s: Allow 10 requests per second per IP

# --- Compression Configuration ---
# Reduces file sizes before sending to browsers (faster page loads, less bandwidth)
gzip on; # Enable compression
gzip_disable "msie6"; # Disable for IE6 (it has bugs with compression)
gzip_comp_level 5; # Compression level 1-9 (5 is a sweet spot: good compression, not too CPU-intensive)
gzip_min_length 256; # Only compress files larger than 256 bytes (tiny files aren't worth compressing)
gzip_proxied any; # Compress responses even if they came from a proxy/upstream server
gzip_vary on; # Add "Vary: Accept-Encoding" header (tells caches to store compressed & uncompressed versions separately)
gzip_types # Which file types to compress (don't list text/html - it's always compressed)
application/javascript
application/json
application/xml
text/javascript
text/css
text/plain
text/xml;

# HTTP SERVER: Port 80 (Insecure) - REDIRECT TO HTTPS
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name marketmap.club www.marketmap.club;

    # Certbot needs HTTP access to verify you own the domain, this MUST be accessible on port 80 (before the HTTPS redirect)
    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        root /var/www/certbot;
        add_header Cache-Control "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate" always; # Certbot tmp files here no caching
    }

    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}

# HTTPS SERVER: Port 443 (Secure) - MAIN APPLICATION
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    http2 on;
    server_name marketmap.club www.marketmap.club;

    root /usr/share/nginx/html; # Where your React build files live
    index index.html; # Default file to serve

    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log main buffer=16k flush=10s;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log warn; # Only log warnings and errors (not every little thing)

    # --- SSL Certificate Configuration ---
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/marketmap.club/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/marketmap.club/privkey.pem;
    # These files are created by Certbot

    # --- SSL Security Settings ---
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3; # Only allow modern, secure protocols (no SSLv3, TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1 - they're broken)
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on; # Server chooses the cipher (more secure)
    ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384;
    # Supported encryption algorithms (prioritizes "forward secrecy" ciphers)

    # --- SSL Session Optimization ---
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m; # Cache SSL sessions for 10MB (speeds up reconnections)
    ssl_session_timeout 1d; # Keep cached sessions for 1 day
    ssl_session_tickets off; # Disable session tickets (better security, prevents certain attacks)


    # --- Security Headers ---
    # IMPORTANT: Only enable these after HTTPS is fully working!

    # Clickjacking protection - prevents embedding in iframes
    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;

    # Prevent MIME type sniffing - forces browser to respect Content-Type
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;

    # Force HTTPS for 1 year - prevents downgrade attacks
    # CAUTION: Once enabled, ALL subdomains must support HTTPS too
    # add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
    # add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=86400" always;
    # Just 1 day - great for testing

    # Referrer policy - controls what information is sent to other sites
    add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" always;
    # Same-origin: Full URL sent
    # Cross-origin: Only origin sent (privacy)

    # Permissions Policy - restricts browser features
    add_header Permissions-Policy "geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=(), payment=(), usb=()" always;

    # Content Security Policy - CRITICAL for XSS protection
    # This needs customization based on app
    # Start with a basic policy and adjust as needed:
    # add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; font-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self' https:; frame-ancestors 'self';" always;

    # Content Security Policy (Tailored for Vite + MapLibre)
    # add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://tiles.openfreemap.org; img-src 'self' data: https: blob:; font-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self' https://tiles.openfreemap.org; worker-src 'self' blob:; frame-ancestors 'self';" always;
    # BREAKDOWN:
    # - default-src 'self': Only load resources from your domain by default
    # - script-src: Allow your JS + inline scripts (Vite requirement) + eval (Turf.js uses it)
    # - style-src: Your CSS + inline styles + OpenFreeMap styles
    # - img-src: Your images + data URIs + HTTPS images + blobs (for map tiles)
    # - connect-src: API calls to your server + OpenFreeMap tiles
    # - worker-src: Web workers (MapLibre uses these) from your domain + blobs
    # - frame-ancestors: Can only be framed by your domain

    # NOTE: 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval' weaken CSP but are required for:
    # - Vite's development hot module replacement
    # - Some Turf.js operations
    # - MapLibre GL JS inline workers
    # For maximum security, use CSP nonces in production (requires build changes)


    # Same as HTTP version - needed for renewals
    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        root /var/www/certbot;
        add_header Cache-Control "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate" always;
    }

    # --- Static Assets: Hashed Files (Long-term Cache) ---
    # Files with content hashes in their name (e.g., main.a3f2b9.js), React's build process (npm run build) creates these automatically
    location ~* \.(js|css)$ {
        add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable, max-age=31536000" always;
        # Cache for 1 year - safe because filename changes when content changes because of hashing
        # immutable = "Don't even check for updates" (perfect for hashed files)
        limit_req zone=general_limit burst=20 nodelay;
        # Apply rate limiting
    }

    # GeoJSON (updated occasionally)
    location ~* \.geojson$ {
        add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=3600" always;
        add_header Content-Type "application/geo+json" always;
        limit_req zone=general_limit burst=20 nodelay;
    }

    # --- Static Assets: Images & Fonts (Medium-term Cache) ---
    # These change less frequently but don't always have hashed filenames
    location ~* \.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|eot|webp|avif)$ {
        add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=2592000" always;
        # No immutable - allows revalidation if you update images
        limit_req zone=general_limit burst=20 nodelay;
        # Apply rate limiting
    }

    # --- HTML Files (Always Fresh) ---
    # Your main index.html - this should always be fresh
    # so users get the latest version immediately
    location ~* \.html$ {
        add_header Cache-Control "no-cache" always;
        # Browser revalidates when online, uses cache when offline
        limit_req zone=general_limit burst=20 nodelay;
        # Apply rate limiting
    }

    # --- React Application (SPA Routing) ---
    # This MUST come last (it's a catch-all)
    location / {
        # SPA Magic: Try to serve the file, if not found, serve index.html
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
        # EXAMPLE: User visits /about
        # 1. Try /about (file doesn't exist)
        # 2. Try /about/ (directory doesn't exist)
        # 3. Serve /index.html (fallback to index.html)

        # Apply rate limiting
        limit_req zone=general_limit burst=20 nodelay;
        # - burst=20: Allow bursts of up to 20 requests (above the 10r/s rate)
        # - nodelay: Don't make fast users wait if they're within burst limit

    }
}
